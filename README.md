# Recommender-Systems

This repo contains some of my work for the Web Mining and Recommendation Systems course at UCSD, CSE Department.

The 3 homework assignments cover various fundamental topics. The performance is graded on pre-determined criteria, unlike the project.

The project is an extension of the third homework. It is about predicting whether a customer owns a certain item, and the rating that they will give to this item. The performance on this assignment was graded by a Kaggle competition of over 600 total students. For the first task I was in top 10% while for the second I was at top 25%.
